    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we load and analyze two velocity datasets derived from DART impact simulations on the Didymos–Dimorphos binary system. Each dataset contains 1000 velocity samples for a single simulated particle: one dataset corresponds to a particle that escapes the binary system after the impact, while the other corresponds to a particle that remains inside the system (due to impact on Didymos or Dimorphos, or by being placed on an unstable orbit). The raw files are located in the `data/raw/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective\n",
    "- Identify whether there are clear turning points or threshold regions in the velocity distributions that separate escape from retention.\n",
    "- Build machine learning models capable of mapping the probability of escape as a function of velocity features and to estimate critical velocity ranges where the transition occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis workflow\n",
    "- Data loading and validation: read CSV files, check for missing or inconsistent values, and verify units.\n",
    "- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): histograms, kernel density estimates, scatter plots, and comparison of distributions between the two groups.\n",
    "- Feature engineering: compute scalar speed, velocity components, and any transformations that improve separability for modeling.\n",
    "- Machine learning modeling: train interpretable classifiers (e.g., logistic regression) and non-linear models (e.g., Random Forest) to predict escape vs retention.\n",
    "- Turning point detection: analyze model decision functions and probability curves, and compute derivatives of the escape probability with respect to velocity to estimate threshold regions.\n",
    "- Validation and interpretation: use cross-validation and metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision/recall), and apply feature-importance methods (e.g., permutation importance or SHAP) to interpret results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical notes\n",
    "- Subsequent cells provide code to load the files from `data/raw/`, produce EDA figures, train models with cross-validation, and save key outputs to `results/`.\n",
    "- Save important figures, models, and tables to the `results/` folder for later reference and inclusion in the thesis."
