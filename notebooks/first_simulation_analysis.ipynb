    "### FIRST SIMULATION DATASET ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook we will analyze the first dataset provided by Dr. Langner.\n",
    "The Dataset has the following characteristics:\n",
    "The columns in csv file are\n",
    " - n -- number of the particle\n",
    "size -- diameter (in meters), now it is equal to 1.0 for all objects\n",
    " - x,y,z -- initial position (meters) in Dimorphos rotating reference frame (IAU_Dimorphos)\n",
    " - vx,vy,vz -- initial velocities (meters/second) in Dimorphos rotating reference frame (IAU_Dimorphos)\n",
    " - t0 - initial time, in this case it is a dummy column with 0.0 for all objects\n",
    " - st - status; 0--survived; 1--escaped; 2--collision with Didimos; 3-- collision with Dimorphos\n",
    " - time_end -- time (days) when particle is removed from simulation (impact or escape time or 3000 for survivors). Note: for performance reasons the    current version of the code checks for escapes only at the end of each integration period, in this case it is 1 day, so for escaped objects the time_end is rounded up to a full day, but if you need better precision I can change it.\n",
    " - xfinal,yfinal,zfinal,vxfinal,vyfinal,vzfinal -- final positions of the object, these columns contents depend on the status. If st=0 (survived) it is the final position and velocity in barycentric reference frame (non rotating). If st=1 (escaped) -- the values are 0.0. If st=2 it is the impact position and velocity in Didimos rotating reference frame. And for st=3 it is  the impact position and velocity in Dimorphos rotating reference frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object is considered to have escaped when it reaches the distance of 5*r_hill which is ~300 km. This distance is chosen to be simple and to give a very large margin for objects that are temporarily on escape trajectory to return to the system. If I choose a different definition of what we consider an escaped object, the times of escape will be different.\n"
